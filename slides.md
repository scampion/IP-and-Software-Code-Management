# Why OSS Compliance matters ? 
---------------------------------

## ‚àô Claim money for non-compliance
An attack simply by claiming money due to non-compliance is something you do not want to have on your desk because you will you have to ensure and achieve compliance but in a very short time frame     
[Copyright Trolling: Abusive Litigation Based on a GPL Compliance](https://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/02/copyright-trolling-abusive-litigation.html)

## ‚àô Breach of contracts 

if you do not provide sufficient information on open source licenses contained in your software this may be considered a contractual breach

## ‚àô Mergers and Acquisitions 
Essential for the purchaser to know to what extent is open source software contained in that company. 


Some cases this led to a massive price decrease due to a larger ip issues or non-compliance

## Recommandations

### Communicate with the upstream suppliers in advance
### Get your suppliers involved with OpenChain
### Ideas: 
#### Put penalties for failure to disclose open source software in procurement agreements with suppliers
#### Or, require permission in advance to deliver components with OSS

### License manifest (should ask your supplier to provides a manifest for ALL the file in the device)
### Don't do license tracking and source publication as an afterthought 

### Build and verify
#### "compliance-build" script 
#### Use docker container or VMs to encapsulate the build environment
