## 1. Downstream : IP rights relevant to software
## 2. Upstream: Focus on OSS Compliance

## A fundamental prerequisite
## manage your source code
<br>
### Objective: easily identify the origin of each line of your software
---

# ‚öôÔ∏è Your code source history
_____________________________

### - Use a version control system like GIT  
##### ‚àô Deploy forge like [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Gitea](https://gitea.io/) 
##### ‚àô Make it use mandatory
.float-right.width-52.pt-xxs.pl-xs[![](./img/blame.jpg)]

##### ‚àô Use `git blame` to discover who is coding what and why (commit message)
### - [Sign your Work](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work), use GPG when you commit 
### - Prohibit third parties copy/paste as much as possible
##### Use language packaging system like Maven for Java, pip for python etc ... 
##### ... if not possible, place it in a dedicated folder `third-libs` and check license presence

# Patents  üìú 
______________

.center.font-xxl["The law relating to the patentability of software is still not harmonized internationally"]

------
    In EU software patents doesn't exists but ... patent could be use to protect your idea.
    In that case, if your technical approach is new, you can decide to create a patent which will describe in terms of 
    input/output and process how to solve an issue.
Duplicate a software in another language is possible. If it use a patented technic, it's less true. 

Be aware, it works in both side, your idea may be already patented, a prior art search is always useful.

# Trade secrets üïµÔ∏è
------------------

### Hard to implement for sofware
#### - Reverse engineering is a well widespread practise üîÑ
<br>

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Online service exception
#### - ‚ö†Ô∏è Beware of [Cloud act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act)
<br>

### If you need to protect your software  
### ‚àô use code obfuscation techniques 
### ‚àô use runtime packer üì¶
- This software compresses files and then unpacks itself when a program or file is ready to be executed
- widely used by malwares difficult to deploy

# Copyrights ¬© 
_____________
Copyright law and patent law provide different types of protection.
    
    Copyright protection extends only to expressions, and not to ideas, procedures, methods of
    operation or mathematical concepts as such, whereas a patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention, 
    which is a product or a process that provides a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical
    solution to a problem.

    Copyright protection is granted from the sole fact of the creation of the computer program.

# Why OSS Compliance matters ? 
---------------------------------

## ‚àô Claim money for non-compliance
An attack simply by claiming money due to non-compliance is something you do not want to have on your desk because you will you have to ensure and achieve compliance but in a very short time frame     
[Copyright Trolling: Abusive Litigation Based on a GPL Compliance](https://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/02/copyright-trolling-abusive-litigation.html)

## ‚àô Breach of contracts 

if you do not provide sufficient information on open source licenses contained in your software this may be considered a contractual breach

## ‚àô Mergers and Acquisitions 
Essential for the purchaser to know to what extent is open source software contained in that company. 


Some cases this led to a massive price decrease due to a larger ip issues or non-compliance

.center[*License obligations are easily infringed as many licenses do require a number of obligations*]

# üìú Open source policy

##Define your policy governing the open source license compliance:
### - of the Supplied Software (Open source and others) 
### - for contributions to open source projects

### *[SPDX](https://spdx.org/)* is an open standard for communicating software bill of material information (including components, licenses, copyrights, and security references). 
The SPDX specification is developed by the SPDX workgroup, which is hosted by The Linux Foundation.

The grassroots effort includes representatives from more than 20 organizations‚Äîsoftware, systems and tool vendors, foundations and systems integrators.

### *[CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/)* purpose-built for software security contexts and supply chain component analysis. 

The specification is maintained by the CycloneDX Core working group, with origins in the [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) community

### üèó Build and verify often as possible, as soon as possible.
<br>
.center["Discovered a compliance issue at the end of the development process]
.center[is more embarrassing than during the development itself"]
<br>

#### - Setup your "compliance-build" script 
#### - Use docker container or VMs to encapsulate the build environment

---

## üßæ With others suppliers
-----------------------------

### 1. Communicate with the upstream suppliers in advance
#### Get your suppliers involved with OpenChain
##### Ideas: 
##### Put penalties for failure to disclose open source software in procurement agreements with suppliers
##### Or, require permission in advance to deliver components with OSS

### 2. License manifest (should ask your supplier to provides a manifest for ALL the file in the device)
### 3. Don't do license tracking and source publication as an afterthought
