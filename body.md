# ‚öôÔ∏è Best practises
________________

### - Use a version control system like Git 

#####  ‚àô Deploy forge like [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Gitea](https://gitea.io/) 
##### ‚àô Make it use mandatory
##### ‚àô Source code traceability `git blame` to discover who is coding what 
### - [Sign your Work](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work) use GPG when you commit 
### - Prohibit third parties copy/paste as much as possible
##### Use language packaging system like Maven for Java, pip for python etc ... 
##### ... otherwise but it in a dedicated folder `third-libs` and check that a license exist

- software compresses files and then unpacks itself when a program or file is ready to be executed
- widely used by malwares difficult to deploy

# Why OSS Compliance matters ? 
---------------------------------

## ‚àô Claim money for non-compliance
An attack simply by claiming money due to non-compliance is something you do not want to have on your desk because you will you have to ensure and achieve compliance but in a very short time frame     
[Copyright Trolling: Abusive Litigation Based on a GPL Compliance](https://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/02/copyright-trolling-abusive-litigation.html)

## ‚àô Breach of contracts 

if you do not provide sufficient information on open source licenses contained in your software this may be considered a contractual breach

## ‚àô Mergers and Acquisitions 
Essential for the purchaser to know to what extent is open source software contained in that company. 


Some cases this led to a massive price decrease due to a larger ip issues or non-compliance

# Best practices : Compliance in your CI / CD pipeline
-------------------------------------------------------

Build and verify often as possible, as soon as possible.

Discovered a compliance issue at the end of the development process is more embarrassing than during the development itself


#### "compliance-build" script 
#### Use docker container or VMs to encapsulate the build environment



---
## üßæ Recommendations
---------------------

### Communicate with the upstream suppliers in advance
### Get your suppliers involved with OpenChain
### Ideas: 
#### Put penalties for failure to disclose open source software in procurement agreements with suppliers
#### Or, require permission in advance to deliver components with OSS

### License manifest (should ask your supplier to provides a manifest for ALL the file in the device)
### Don't do license tracking and source publication as an afterthought
